A guide to install python Virtual Environment can be seen [here](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/).<br>

In command propmpt, go to your ClassExercise directory and run the following command
c:\In-Class_Exercise_1>python -m venv env
c:\In-Class_Exercise_1\env>Scripts\Activate

Remember that everytime you take a break and then decide to go back to working on this assignment, you will need to activate your virtualenv to use the dependencies. You can activate your virtualenv by calling:
c:\In-Class_Exercise_1\env>Scripts\Deactivate

## Install dependencies
c:\In-Class_Exercise_1>pip install -r requirements.txt

Now you are ready to work on InClassExercise-1.ipynb and Start the notebook by calling:
c:\In-Class_Exercise_1>jupyter notebook

Now go to your web browser (ex, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox) and go the this url: localhost:8888. Click on InClassExercise-1.ipynb to start working on the assignment.

This exercise is for your practice only. No submission is needed.
